--- abstract

This document describes a protocol called K-Check for implementing HTTP resource consistency checks.
The primary use case for K-Check is for deployments of protocols such as Privacy Pass and Oblivious
HTTP in which privacy goals require that clients have a consistent view of some protocol-specific
resource (typically, a public key).

# Introduction

Privacy-enhancing protocols such as Privacy Pass {{PRIVACYPASS}} and Oblivious HTTP {{OHTTP}}
require clients to obtain and use a public key for execution. In Privacy Pass,
public keys are used by clients when issuing and redeeming tokens for anonymous
authorization. In Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP), clients use public keys to encrypt
messages to a gateway server.

Deployments of protocols such as Privacy Pass and OHTTP requires that very large sets of clients
share the same key, or even that all clients globally share the same key. This is because the privacy properties depend on the client
anonymity set size. In other words, the key that's used determines the set to which
a particular client belongs. Using a unique, client-specific key would yield an anonymity set
of size one, therefore violating the desired privacy goals of the system. Clients that
use the same key as one another are said to have a consistent view of the key.

{{CONSISTENCY}} describes this notion of consistency in more detail. It also outlines
several designs that can be used as the basis for consistency systems. This document is
a concrete instantiation of one of those designs, "Shared Cache Discovery". In particular,
this document describes a protocol called K-Check, based on {{DOUBLE-CHECK}},
for checking that an HTTP resource is consistent with the view of one or more so-called mirrors.
In this context, a mirror is an HTTP resource that fetches and caches copies of an HTTP resource
for clients to use for consistency checks. More specifically, clients obtain copies of
a desired resource from a mirror and then compare those copies to their resource.

K-Check is a generic protocol for consistency checks of HTTP resources, and therefore is suitable
for any protocol that needs consistency of an HTTP resource. {{profile-privacypass}} and {{profile-ohttp}}
describe Privacy Pass and OHTTP profiles for K-Check, respectively.

# Terminology

The following terms are used throughout this document:

- Resource: A HTTP resource identified by a URL.
- Normalized resource representation: A unique or otherwise protocol-specific representation
  that is derived from an HTTP resource. The process of normalization is specific to a
  protocol and the resource in question.
- Mirror: A HTTP resource that fetches and caches HTTP resources.

# Mirror Protocol

The mirror protocol is a simple HTTP-based protocol similar to a reverse proxy. Each mirror
resource, henceforth referred to as a mirror, is identified by a Mirror URI Template {{!RFC6570}}.
The scheme for the Mirror URI Template MUST be "https". The Mirror URI Template uses the Level
3 encoding defined {{Section 1.2 of RFC6570}} and contains one variables: "target", which is the
percent-encoded URL of a HTTP resource to be mirrored. Example Mirror URI Templates are shown below.

~~~
https://mirror.example/mirror{?target}
https://mirror.example/{target}
~~~

The Mirror URI Template MUST contain the "target" variable exactly once. The variable
MUST be within the path or query components of the URI.

In addition, each mirror is configured with a MIN_VALIDITY_WINDOW parameter, which is an integer
indicating the minimum time for resources the mirror will cache according to their "max-age"
response directive. We refer to the validity window of the mirror response as the period of
time determined by the Cache-Control headers as the response.

Clients send requests to mirror resources after being configured with their corresponding
Mirror URI Template. Clients MUST ignore configurations that do not conform to this template.

Upon receipt of a mirror request, mirrors validate the incoming request. If the request is invalid
or malformed, e.g., the "target" parameter is not a correctly encoded URL, the mirror aborts
and returns a a 4xx (Client Error) to the client. The mirror SHOULD check that the target resource
identified by the "target" parameter is allowed by policy, e.g., so that it is not abused to
fetch arbitrary resources. One way to implement this check is via an allowlist of target URLs.

If the request is valid and allowed, the mirror checks to see if it has a cached version of the
resource identified by the target URL. Mirrors can provide a cached response to a client request
if the following criteria are met:

1. The target URL matches that of a cached response.
1. The cached response is fresh according to its Cache-Control header (see {{Section 4.2 of ?CACHING=RFC9111}}).

If both criteria are met, the mirror encodes the cached response using Binary HTTP {{!BHTTP=RFC9292}}
and returns it to the client in a response. The mirror response incldues a Cache-Control header
with "max-age" directive set to that of the cached response.

Otherwise, mirrors send a GET request to the target resource URL, copying the Accept header from
the client request if present. If this request fails, the mirror returns a 4xx error to the client.
Otherwise, the response to a mirror request is the content that was contained in the target resource.
If this request suceeeds, the mirror checks it for validity. The response is considered valid and stored
in the mirror's cache if the following criteria are met:

1. The response can be cached according to the rules in {{Section 3 of CACHING}}. In particular,
   if the request had a Vary header, this is used in determining whether the mirror's response is valid.
1. The Cache-Control header is present, has a "max-age" response directive that is
   greater than or equal to MIN_VALIDITY_WINDOW, and does not have a "no-store" or "private" directive.

If the response is valid, the response is stored in the mirror's cache. Mirrors purge this cache when
the response is no longer valid according to the Cache-Control headers.

To complete the client request, the mirror then encodes the response using Binary
HTTP {{BHTTP}} and returns it to the client in a response. The mirror response incldues a
Cache-Control header with "max-age" directive set to that of the cached response.

Clients recover the target's mirrored response by Binary HTTP decoding the mirror response
content.

## Mirror Request and Respnose Example

The following example shows two mirror request and response examples. The first one yields a mirror
cache miss and the second one yields a mirror cache hit. The Mirror URI Template is
"https://mirror.example/mirror{?target}", and the target URL is
"https://issuer.example/.well-known/private-token-issuer-directory".

The first client request to the mirror might be the following.

~~~
:method = GET
:scheme = https
:authority = mirror.example
:path = /mirror?target=https%3A%2F%2Fissuer.example%2F.well-known%2Fprivate-token-issuer-directory
accept = application/private-token-issuer-directory
~~~

Upon receipt, the mirror decodes the "target" parameter, inspects its cache for a copy of the
resource, and then constructs a HTTP request to the target URL to fetch the content. If present,
the relay copies the Accept header from the client request to the request sent to the target.
This mirror request to the target might be the following.

~~~
:method = GET
:scheme = https
:authority = target.example
:path = /.well-known/private-token-issuer-directory
accept = application/private-token-issuer-directory
~~~

The target response is then returned to the mirror, like so:

~~~
:status = 200
content-type = application/private-token-issuer-directory
content-length = ...
cache-control: max-age=3600

<Bytes containing a private token issuer directory>
~~~

The mirror caches this response content for the target URL, encodes it using Binary HTTP {{BHTTP}},
and then returns the response to the client:

~~~
:status = 200
content-length = ...
cache-control: max-age=3600

<Bytes containing the target's BHTTP-encoded response>
~~~

When a second client asks for the same request by the mirror it can be served with the cached
copy. The second client's request might be the following:

~~~
:method = GET
:scheme = https
:authority = mirror.example
:path = /mirror?target=https%3A%2F%2Fissuer.example%2F.well-known%2Fprivate-token-issuer-directory
~~~

The mirror validates the request, locates the cached copy of the
"https://issuer.example/.well-known/private-token-issuer-directory" content, and then
returns it to the client without updating its cached copy.

~~~
:status = 200
content-length = ...
cache-control: max-age=3600

<Bytes containing the target's BHTTP-encoded response>
~~~

# K-Check {#k-check}

Clients are configured with 1) the URLs for one or more mirror resources, and 2) a non-zero positive
integer value t that defines the required threshold for success. Each URL identifies an API endpoint
that clients use to obtain mirrored copies of a resource.

The input to K-Check is a candidate HTTP resource, a target URL at which the resource
was obtained, and a representation of the input resource. To check this
resource, the client runs the following steps for each configured mirror.

1. Send a mirror request to the mirror for the target URL. If the request fails, fail
   this mirror check.
1. Otherwise, compute the first valid representation of the resource based on the mirror's response.
1. Compare the computed representation to the input representation. If they do not match,
   fail this mirror check. Otherwise, this mirror check succeeds.

If at least t mirror checks succeed, the client outputs success. Otherwise, the client has
detected an inconsistency and outputs fail.

The choice of t allows a client to manage risk associated with sporatic network failure or a misbehaving
mirror causing denial of service. A higher value of t provides better consistency guarantees, but with
lower tolerance for failures.

[[OPEN ISSUE: Can mirrors somehow communicate the number of “active users” to clients? How would mirrors determine client uniqueness? And finally, if mirrors did this accurately, how would clients use this information?]]

## Privacy Pass Profile {#profile-privacypass}

Clients are given as input an issuer token key from an origin server and want to check
whether it is consistent with the key that is given to other clients. Let the input key
be denoted token_key and its identifier be token_key_id. Clients are also given as input
the name of the issuer, from which they can construct the target URL for the issuer
directory. If clients have already checked this issuer’s token key, i.e., they’ve
previously run K-Check, they can simply reuse the result up to its expiration. Otherwise,
clients invoke K-Check in parallel with the issuance protocol.

Each issuer directory can yield one or more normalized representations that clients use
in the K-Check protocol. For example, given a mirrored token directory resource like the
following:

~~~
{
  "issuer-request-uri": "https://issuer.example.net/request",
  "token-keys": [
    {
      "token-type": 2,
      "token-key": "MI...AB",
      "not-before": 1686913811,
    },
    {
      "token-type": 2,
      "token-key": "MI...AQ",
    }
  ]
}
~~~

Clients compute the first valid representation of this directory, i.e., the first entry in the list that the client can use, which might be the key ID
of the first key in the "token-keys" list (depending on the "not-before" value), or the
key ID of the second key in the "token-keys" list. The key ID is computed as defined in
{{Section 6.5 of PRIVACYPASS-ISSUANCE}}.

## Oblivious HTTP Profile {#profile-ohttp}

Clients can run K-Check for OHTTP in several ways depending on the deployment. In practice,
common deployments are as follows:

1. Clients are configured with gateway configurations; and
1. Clients fetch gateway configurations before use.

In both cases, clients begin with a gateway configuration and want to check it for consistency.
In OHTTP, there is exactly one representation for a gateway configuration – the configuration itself.
Before using the configuration to encrypt a binary HTTP message to the gateway, clients can run
K-Check with their configured mirrors to ensure that this configuration is correct for the given gateway.

# Security Considerations

K-Check assumes that a subset of client-configured mirrors are honest. The exact guarantees depend on the
configured threshold t, defined in {{k-check}}. Under this assumption, the consistency properties of K-Check
are as follows:

1. With honest mirrors, clients that successfully check a resource are assured that they
   share the same copy of the resource with the union of mirror clients for each configured mirror.
1. Consistency only holds for the period of time of the minimum mirror validity window.
1. Discovering an inconsistency requires that at least k - t + 1 mirrors are honest.

Unless all clients share the same configured mirrors, K-Check does not achieve global consistency
as is defined in {{CONSISTENCY}}.
